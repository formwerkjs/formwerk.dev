# What is Formwerk?

Formwerk is a library of headless composables for Vue.js that helps you build accessible, high-quality form components for your applications or design systems.

It offers you a comprehensive tree-shakable set of composables that take care of accessibility, interaction, validation, and best behavior practices out of the box, allowing you to focus on your unique design and styling.

This library aims to offer an uncompromising new baseline of accessibility, interaction, and quality for building forms in Vue.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1.  Install Formwerk with your package manager of choice.

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">

    ```bash
    npm install @formwerk/core
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">

    ```bash
    pnpm add @formwerk/core
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">

    ```bash
    bun add @formwerk/core
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">

    ```bash
    yarn add @formwerk/core
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2.  Import the composable you need into your component.

    ```vue title="TextField.vue"
    <script setup lang="ts">
    import { TextFieldProps, useTextField } from '@formwerk/core';

    const props = defineProps<TextFieldProps>();

    const { inputProps, labelProps, errorMessage, errorMessageProps } =
      useTextField(props);
    </script>

    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-bind="labelProps">{{ label }}</label>
        <input v-bind="inputProps" />

        <div v-if="errorMessage" v-bind="errorMessageProps">
          {{ errorMessage }}
        </div>
      </div>
    </template>
    ```

3.  Use your component!

    ```vue title="App.vue"
    <script setup>
    import { TextField } from './TextField.vue';

    const email = ref('');
    </script>

    <template>
      <TextField label="Email" type="email" v-model="email" />
    </template>
    ```

</Steps>
