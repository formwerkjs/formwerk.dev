<Aside title="Dependency Disclaimer">

In order to deliver true i18n for international audiences, Formwerk's calendar composable depends on [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) to provide these functionalities.

If you do not use the Calendar or Date Field composables, the dependency will not be included in your bundle as it is fully tree-shakable.

Formwerk fully intends on migrating to the [Temporal API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal) in the future once they receive full or partial baseline support.

</Aside>

Calendars are used to allow users to select a date, for example to select a date of birth or a date for a reservation.

Calendar components in Formwerk can be used with a [date field](/guides/fields/date-fields/) or as a standalone component.

## Features

- Labeling, Descriptions, and error messages are automatically linked to the calendar elements.
- Supports different views (week, month, year) to allow for large date range navigation.
- Support for multiple calendars (e.g: `islamic-umalqura`, `japanese`, etc).
- Supports minimum and maximum date boundaries.
- Validation support with [Standard Schemas](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema).
- Auto directionality based on the locale.
- Cell states for today, selected, disabled and outside month dates.
- Support for `v-model` binding.
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts support.

## Building a Calendar Component

You can start by importing the `useCalendar` composable and using it in your calendar component.

The `useCalendar` composable returns binding objects for the elements shown in the [anatomy](#anatomy). You will use `v-bind` to bind them to the corresponding DOM elements.

<MdxRepl client:load preview-size="xl">

<div slot="Calendar.vue">
  <CalendarPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Calendar from './Calendar.vue';
import { ref } from 'vue';

const date = ref(new Date('2025-09-14'));
</script>

<template>
  <Calendar label="Select a date" v-model="date" />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

Note that Formwerk already exposes a `CalendarCell` component that renders a span by default for convenience. It provides handling for user interactions and accessibility attributes.

You can build your own calendar cell component and customize it as needed with `useCalendarCell` composable.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useCalendarCell, type CalendarCellProps } from '@formwerk/core';

const props = defineProps<CalendarCellProps>();

const { cellProps, label } = useCalendarCell(props);
</script>

<template>
  <div v-bind="cellProps">
    {{ label }}
  </div>
</template>
```

## Usage

### Disabled

Use `disabled` to mark calendar as non-interactive. Disabled calendars are not validated and are not submitted.

If you need to prevent the user from interacting with the calendar while still allowing it to submit, consider using `readonly` instead.

<MdxRepl client:load preview-size="xl">

<div slot="!Calendar.vue">
  <CalendarPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Calendar from './Calendar.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <Calendar label="Disabled Calendar" disabled />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

### Readonly

Readonly calendars are validated and submitted, but they do not accept user input. The calendar is still focusable. For more info, check the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly).

<MdxRepl client:load preview-size="xl">

<div slot="!Calendar.vue">
  <CalendarPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Calendar from './Calendar.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <Calendar label="Readonly Calendar" readonly />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

### Locale and Calendar Support

The `calendar` prop can be used to specify which calendar to use, along with the `locale` prop to set the locale of the calendar.

You can use `@internationalized/date` to create calendar objects. In this example, we will use the `islamic-umalqura` calendar along with the `ar-SA` locale.

<MdxRepl client:load preview-size="xl">

<div slot="!Calendar.vue">
  <CalendarPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  createCalendar,
  IslamicUmalquraCalendar,
} from '@internationalized/date';
import Calendar from './Calendar.vue';

// This will import all calendars available.
// Resulting in a larger bundle size.
const calendar = createCalendar('islamic-umalqura');

// This will import only the Islamic Umalqura calendar.
// This allows tree-shaking, reducing the bundle size.
// const calendar = IslamicUmalquraCalendar;
</script>

<template>
  <Calendar label="Calendar" :calendar="calendar" locale="ar-SA" />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

<Aside title="Value type with `calendar` prop" type="caution">

When using a non-Gregorian calendar system (like Islamic or Japanese calendars), the `calendar` composable will still use JavaScript's native `Date` objects internally. This means that even though you may see dates displayed in your chosen calendar system, the actual value emitted by the component will be the equivalent Gregorian date.

For example, if you select "1 Muharram 1445" in the Islamic calendar, the emitted value will be a `Date` object representing "July 19, 2023" in the Gregorian calendar.

We're interested in hearing from users who work with different calendar systems - how would you prefer to handle these date values? Please share your feedback with us.

</Aside>

### Min and Max

You can pass `min` and `max` props to set the minimum and maximum dates that can be selected. You will still need to handle styling those dates, out of range dates will be marked with `aria-disabled` attribute.

<MdxRepl client:load preview-size="xl">

<div slot="!Calendar.vue">
  <CalendarPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Calendar from './Calendar.vue';

// You need to be careful with the time component of the date object.
// JS date objects fills the date time with the current time component.
const min = new Date(2025, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0);
const value = new Date('2025-01-15');
const max = new Date('2025-01-20');
</script>

<template>
  <Calendar label="Calendar" :value="value" :min="min" :max="max" />
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

## Usage as a picker

You can use the `Calendar` component as a picker which can be useful to pair with a [date field](/guides/fields/date-fields/).

To do that, you can use the `usePicker` composable:

<MdxRepl client:load preview-size="xl">

<div slot="!Calendar.vue">
  <CalendarPartial />
</div>

<div slot="App.vue">

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { usePicker } from '@formwerk/core';
import Calendar from './Calendar.vue';

const { pickerProps, pickerTriggerProps } = usePicker({
  label: 'Pick a date',
});

const date = ref();
</script>

<template>
  <pre>Selected date: {{ date || 'none' }}</pre>
  <button v-bind="pickerTriggerProps">Open Calendar</button>

  <div v-bind="pickerProps" popover>
    <Calendar label="Calendar" v-model="date" />
  </div>
</template>
```

</div>

</MdxRepl>

In that example, we are using the popover API, but you can use any other floating UI solution you prefer.
