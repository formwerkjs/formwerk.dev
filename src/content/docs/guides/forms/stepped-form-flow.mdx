Stepped form flows are a very common pattern around the web. They are used to guide users through a form in a typically linear way, but not necessarily.

Aside from collecting information from users, they serve many purposes, common ones being:

- Split up large forms into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Conditionally navigate through steps based on user input.

Before we dive into the details, let's clear up some terminology:

- **Linear flow**: The user is required to complete all steps in order, every step is non-skippable.
- **Non-linear flow**: The user can skip steps, some steps might be constrained by previous steps.

## Features

- Automatic navigation through steps in a linear flow or jumping to steps in non-linear flows.
- Schema validation for steps and validates steps before moving to the next one.
- Accessible next/previous navigation buttons.
- Custom step names.
