Formwerk composables treat internationalization as a first class concern. It's not just about translating the labels and messages. It's mainly about catering to specifics of each locale audience and giving them the best experience possible.

If you didn't work with internationalization before, you might be surprised how the web still misses the mark in many cases. Here are a few examples:

- The `input[type="number"]` only accepts latin numerals. This causes issues for those with non-latin locales and keyboard layouts.
- Some keyboard layouts lack the semantically correct commas, and decimal separators, yet users use identical symbols that usually fails validation.
- Most keyboard shortcuts, especially left/right arrow keys do not respect the directionality of the locale.
- The HTML5 constrained validation API generates messages in the browser's default language, not the website's.

Formwerk composables take all of this into account and more. In this page we'll go over the details of how Formwerk handles internationalization and how you can benefit from it.

## Not an i18n library

Formwerk is not an i18n library. It does not provide a way to translate the labels and messages. But it does its best to offer the best experience it can with Vue's ecosystem.

You can use a dedicated i18n library in tandem with Formwerk like [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/).

## Locale Config

Formwerk exposes a `locale` configuration option that you can set with the `configure` function. This is the main option Formwerk uses to determine locale and [directionality](#directionality).

```ts
import { configure } from '@formwerk/core';

configure({
  locale: 'en-US',
});
```

The default locale is `en-US`.

### Locale auto-detection

By default Formwerk will auto-detect the locale using the html tag's `lang` attribute. It will not use the browser's locale since it may be different from the user's preferred language or the website's target audience.

There is no need to disable this feature since it detects the locale right when Formwerk is imported. So if you set the locale with the `configure` function, it will always respect that setting.

The auto-detection is not available in some environments like server-side rendering (SSR). In those cases you'll need to set the locale manually with the `configure` function.

## Directionality

Formwerk determines the directionality of the locale currently set. It does so using the [Intl.Locale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) API.

This determines the default `dir` property of Formwerk components. You can always override it with the `dir` prop on each composable or you can turn the auto-detection off with the `detectDirection` option.

```ts
import { configure } from '@formwerk/core';

configure({
  detectDirection: false,
});
```

Not all composables react to the direction change, it is up to you to style them accordingly. But the functionality of some components may change as result, especially components that utilize the arrow keys (e.g: sliders).

## Usage with Vue i18n

Formwerk can be used with [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/). Usually it is a good idea to set the locale in the app's main file or entry point where you initialize vue-i18n.

Formwerk accepts a reactive locale value and will automatically update the direction whenever the locale changes.

```ts
import { createI18n } from 'vue-i18n';
import { configure } from '@formwerk/core';

const i18n = createI18n({
  locale: 'en-US',
});

configure({
  // Reactive if legacy: false in vue-i18n options
  locale: i18n.global.locale,
});
```

## Usage with Nuxt i18n

Since there is no `html` tag in SSR environments, Formwerk will not be able to auto-detect the locale. You'll need to set it manually with the `configure` function.

For Nuxt, you would be using [Nuxt i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) module. It is recommended to set the locale in a [plugin](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins) to ensure it happens before Formwerk is used anywhere.

### Using the locale ref

Like with Vue i18n, Formwerk will automatically update the directionality whenever the locale changes if you pass a reactive locale value. So you only have one source of truth to manage.

```ts
import { configure } from '@formwerk/core';

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  configure({
    locale: nuxtApp.$i18n.locale,
  });
});
```

### Using Nuxt Hooks

Alternatively, you can listen to the `i18n:localeSwitched` hook to update the locale and directionality whenever the locale changes with `setLocale` [returned from `useI18n`](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/docs/guide/lang-switcher).

```ts
import { configure } from '@formwerk/core';

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.hook('i18n:localeSwitched', ({ newLocale }) => {
    configure({
      locale: newLocale,
    });
  });
});
```

## HTML Validation Language Mismatch

HTML5 validation messages are generated in the browser's default language, not the website's. This means that if the user's browser is set to a different language than the website's target audience, the validation messages will be in the wrong language.

Unfortunately, there is no way to change the language of the validation messages after they are generated and there is no sufficient JS API to influence the message text. We are considering either building a tiny i18n layer just for this or rely on 3rd party to do it.

For now, the recommended workaround is to disable HTML5 validation messages generation and rely on [Standard Schemas](/guides/forms/validation/#standard-schema-validation/) to provide the validation messages.

You still will be able to pass the `required` and other HTML validation attributes but they will not affect the validity or the messages once disabled.
